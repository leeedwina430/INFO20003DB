    "- Distributed Database<br/>\n",
    "a single **_logical_** database physically spread across multiple computers in multiple locations that are connected be a data communications link<br/>\n",
    "appears to users as though it is one database\n",
    "- Decentralized Database<br/>\n",
    "a collection of independent databases which are not networked together as one logical database<br/>\n",
    "appears to users as though many databases\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pros and Cons\n",
    "### Advantages of DDBMS\n",
    "1. **Good fit for geographically distributed orginizations/users** (utilize the internet)\n",
    "2. **Data located near site with greates demand** (e.g. Facebook data)\n",
    "3. **Faster data access** (to local data)\n",
    "4. **Faster data processing** (workload split amongst physical servers)\n",
    "<center>\n",
    " <img src=\"./figures/week10l1-7.png\" width = \"500\" alt=\"图片名称\" align=center />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Allows modular growth** (add new servers as load increases-horizontal scalability)\n",
    "6. **Increased reliability and availability** (less danger of a single-point of failure (SPOF) if data is replicated)\n",
    "7. **Supports database recovery** (when data is replicated across multiple sites)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of DDBMS\n",
    "1. **Complexity of management and control** (db & application must stitch together data across sites)\n",
    "2. **Data integrity** (what if two users in two locations update the record at the same time? => **Transaction Manager/Master-slave design**)\n",
    "3. **Security** (Many server sites -> high change of breach)\n",
    "4. **Lack of standards** (different DDBMS vendors use different protocals)\n",
    "5. **Increased training & maintenance costs** (disk storage, inter network infrastructure, clustering software, Network speed)\n",
    "6. **Increased storage requirements** (replication model)\n",
    "7. **Location transparency**<br/>\n",
    "A user accessing data do not need to know the location of the data in the network of DBMS<br/>\n",
    "Automatically forwarded by the system to the site or sites related to the processing request.<br/>\n",
    "A single query can join data from tables inmultiple sites\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Local autonomy** (local users can continue use if network's lost)<br/>\n",
    "Being able to operate locally when connections to other databases fail.<br/>\n",
    "Users can administer their local database (control local data, administer security, log transactions, recover when local failures occur, provide full access to local data)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions of a DDBMS\n",
    "1. Locate data with a distributed catalog (meta data)\n",
    "2. Determine location from which to retrieve data and process query components\n",
    "3. DBMS translation between nodes with different local DBMSs (middleware)\n",
    "4. Data consistency (multiphase commit protocols)\n",
    "5. Glocal primary key control\n",
    "6. Scalability\n",
    "7. Security, concurrency, query optimization, failure recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distribution options\n",
    "**Data replication**-a process of duplicating data to different nodes\n",
    "**Data partitioning**-a process of partitioning data into subsets that are shipped to different nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Many real-life systems use a combination of two (partition data and keep some replicas around, 3)\n",
    "<center>\n",
    " <img src=\"./figures/week10l2-1.png\" width = \"500\" alt=\"图片名称\" align=center />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Replication: Pros and Cons\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "1. High reliability due to redundant copies of data\n",
    "2. Fast access to data at the location where it is most accessed\n",
    "3. May avoid complicated distributed integrity routines (Replicated data is refreshed at scheduled intervals)\n",
    "4. Decoupled nodes don't affect data availability (Transactions proceed even if some nodes are down)\n",
    "5. Reduced network traffic at prime time (if updates can be delayed)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is currently popular as a way of achieving high availability for global systems (e.g. Most SQL & NoSQL databases offer replication)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "1. Need more storage space (copy)\n",
    "2. Data integrity (High tolerance for out-of-date data may be required; updates may cause performance problems for busy nodes; Retrieve incorrect data if updates have not arrived)\n",
    "3. Takes time for update operations\n",
    "4. Network communication capabilities (Updates can place heavy demand on telecommunications/networks; High speed networks are expensive)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partitioning\n",
    "Split data into chunks, store chunks in different nodes; A chunk can be a set of rows or columns => **Horizontal partitionning & Vertical partitioning**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Horizontal Partitioning\n",
    "Different rows of a table at different sites\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "1. Data stored close to where it is used--efficiency\n",
    "2. Local access optimization--better performance\n",
    "3. Only relevant data is stored locally--security\n",
    "4. Unions across partitions--ease of query\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    "1. accessing data across partitions--inconsistent access speed\n",
    "2. No data replication--backup vulnerability (SPOF)\n",
    "<center>\n",
    " <img src=\"./figures/week10l2-2.png\" width = \"500\" alt=\"图片名称\" align=center />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vertical Partitioning\n",
    "Different columns of a table at different sites\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros and cons are the same as for horizontal partitioning except\n",
    "- Combining data across partitions is more difficult, because it requires joins (instead of unions)\n",
    "<center>\n",

    "## Trade-offs with DDBMS\n",
    "1. Availability vs Consistency => CAP theorem\n",
    "2. Synchronous vs Asynchronous updates (changes immediatedly visible everywhere or later propagated?)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The CAP theorem\n",
    "You can only have two out of three of Consistency, Availability, and Parition Tolerance \n",
    "<center>\n",
    " <img src=\"./figures/week10l2-4.png\" width = \"400\" alt=\"图片名称\" align=center />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synchronous vs Asynchronous updates\n",
    "**Synchronous**-Data is continuously kept up to date\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro: Ensures data integrity and minimizes the complexity of knowing where the most recent copy of data is located\n",
    "\n",
    "Con: Can result in slow response time and high network usage<br/>\n",
    "(DDBMS spends time checking that an update is accurately and completely propagated across the network; the committed updated record must be identical in all servers)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Asynchronous**-Some delay in propagating data updates to remote databases\n",
    "\n",
    "(Some degree of at least temporary inconsistency is tolerated; may be ok it is temporary and well managed)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro: Acceptable response time<br/>\n",
    "(updates happen locally and data replicas are synchronized in batches and predetermined intervals)\n",
    "\n",
    "Con: May be more complex to plan and design\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which update to use depends on the information systems:**\n",
