    "## Transaction\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "A logical unit of work that must either be entirely completed or aborted (indivisible, atomic), a sequence of DML statements\n",
    "\n",
    "DML statements are already atomic; DBMS also allows for _user-defined_ transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "A successful transaction changes the database from one consistent state to another\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties (ACID)\n",
    "1. **Atomicity**<br/>\n",
    "A transaction is a single, indivisible, logical unit of work. All operations in a transaction must be completed, or the transaction is aborted.\n",
    "2. **Consistency**<br/>\n",
    "Constraints that hold before a transaction must also hold after it<br/>\n",
    "Multiple users accessing the same data see the same value\n",
    "3. **Isolation**<br/>\n",
    "Changes made during execution of a transaction cannot be seen by other transactions until this one is completed\n",
    "4. **Durability**<br/>\n",
    "When a transaction is complete, the changes made to the database are permanent, even if the system fails\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do we need a transaction?\n",
    "Brief: 1. For single users: makes sure that data is consistent (if crashes); 2. For multi-users: prevents concurrency-related conflicts in data reading + writing \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem 1: Unit of work\n",
    "Users need the ability to define a unit of work\n",
    "\n",
    "multiple statements (user-defined transaction)\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    " <img src=\"./figures/week9-1.png\" width = \"200\" alt=\"图片名称\" align=center />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL keywords: `begin/START TRANSACTION`, `commit`, `rollback`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of an error:\n",
    "1. Any SQL statements already completed must be reversed\n",
    "2. Show an error message to the user\n",
    "3. When ready, the user can try the transaction again\n",
    "This is briefly annoying, but inconsistent data is disastrous.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem 2: Concurrent access\n",
    "Concurrent access to data by > 1 user or program\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrent execution of DML against a shared database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems:\n",
    "1. Lost updates (no updates)\n",
    "<center>\n",
    " <img src=\"./figures/week9l2-2.png\" width = \"300\" alt=\"图片名称\" align=center />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Uncommitted data<br/>\n",
    "When two transactions execute concurrently and the first is rolled back after the second has already accessed the uncommitted data.\n",
    "<center>\n",
    " <img src=\"./figures/week9l2-3.png\" width = \"300\" alt=\"图片名称\" align=center />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inconsistent retrievals<br/>\n",
    "When one transaction calculates some aggregate functions over a set of data, while other transactions are updating the data (some data are read after change and some before, inconsistently)<br/>\n",
    "<center>\n",
    " <img src=\"./figures/week9l2-4.png\" width = \"300\" alt=\"图片名称\" align=center />\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Serializability\n",
    "Transactions ideally are serializable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple, concurrent transactions appear as if they were executed one after another\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensures that the concurrent execution of several transactions yields consistent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "But true setial execution (no concurrency) is very expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logging \n",
    "Allow us to restore the database to a previous consistent state (e.g. not completed, aborted => roll back; restore a corrupted database)\n",
    "\n",
    "By tracking all updates to data. Contains:\n",
    "1. A record for the beginning of the transaction\n",
    "2. For each SQL statement: operation being performed (e.g. update, delete, insert); objects affected by the transaction; before and after values for updated fields; pointers to previous and next transaction log entries\n",
    "3. COMMIT (ending of the transaction)\n",
    "\n",
    "When failure occurs, DBMS will examine the log for all uncommitted or incomplete transactions, and restore the database to a precious state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concurrency \n",
    "TO achieve efficient execution of transactions, the DBMS creates a schedule of read and write operations for concurrent transactions.\n",
    "Interleaves the execution of operations, based on concurrency control algorithms:\n",
    "1. Locking (Main method)\n",
    "2. Time stamping\n",
    "3. Optimistic Concurrency Control \n",
    "\n",
    "### Control: Locking\n",
    "#### Basics\n",
    "**Lock:** Guarantees exclusive use of a data item to a current transaction\n",
    " Required to prevent another transaction from reading inconsistent data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lock manager:** Responsible for assigning and policing the locks used by the transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lock Granularity Options\n",
    "1. Database-level lock<br/>\n",
    "Entire database is locked; T1 and T2 can not access the same data base concurrently even if they use different tables<br/>\n",
    "Good for batch processing but unsuitable for multi-user DBMSs\n",
    "2. Table-level lock<br/>\n",
    "Entire table is locked; T1 and T2 can access the same database concurrently as long as they use different tables<br/>\n",
    "Can cause bottlenecks: transactions want to access different parts of the table; Not suitable for highly multi-user DBMSs\n",
    "3. Page-level lock<br/>\n",
    "An entire disk page is locked; <br/>\n",
    "Not commonly used now\n",
    "4. Row-level lock<br/>\n",
    "Allows concurrent transactions to access different rows of the same table, even if the rows are located on the same page<br/>\n",
    "Improves data availability but with high overhead (each row has a lock that must be read and written to)<br/>\n",
    "Currently the most popular approach (MySQL, Oracle)\n",
    "5. Field-level lock<br/>\n",
    "Allows concurrent transactions to access the same row, as long as they access different attributes within that row<br/>\n",
    "Most flexible lock but requires an extremely high level of overhead<br/>\n",
    "__Not commonly used__\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Locks: Binary Lock & Shared and Exclusive (/Read and Write) Locks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Type: Binary Locks\n",
    " 1(locked)/0(unlocked); the lock is not released until the statement is completed\n",
    "\n",
    "Eliminates \"Lost Update\" problem\n",
    "\n",
    "But too restrictive to yield optimal concurrency, as even two READS are locked\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Type: Shared and Exclusive Locks\n",
    "- Exclusive Lock: (when transaction intends to WRITE)<br/>\n",
    "Access is reserved for the transaction that locked the object; Granted iff no other locks are held on the data item (both exclusive & shared locks)<br/>\n",
    "e.g. MySQL: `SELECT ... FOR update`\n",
    "- Shared Lock: (when a transaction wants to READ)<br/>\n",
    "Other transactions are also granted Read access; Issued when no Exclusive lock is held on that data item (can have multiple shared locks)<br/>\n",
    "e.g. MySQL: `SELECT ... FOR share`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deadlock\n",
    "When two transactions wait for each other to unlock data with exclusive locks (could wait forever)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions**\n",
    "1. Prevention\n",
    "2. Detection (then kill one of them; e.g. MySQL-kill the 2nd one)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control: Alternative concurrency control methods\n",
    "1. Timestamp\n",
    "- Assigns a global unique timestamp to each transaction\n",
    "- Each data item accessed by the transaction gets the timestamp\n",
    "- When a transaction wants to read or write, the DBMS compares its timestamp with the timestamps already attached to the item, decides whether to allow access\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Optimistic\n",
    "- Based on the **assumption** that the majority of database operations do not conflict\n",
    "- Transaction is executed without restrictinos or checking\n",
    "- When commit, the DBMS checks whether any of the data it read has been altered, if so then rollback\n",
