    "### Definition & 3Vs\n",
    "Data that exist in very large volumes and many different varieties (data types) and that need to be processed at a very high velocity (speed)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Volume**-Much larger quantity of data than typical for relational DBs\n",
    "- **Variety**-Lots of different data types and formats\n",
    "- **Velocity**-data comes at very fast rate (e.g. mobile sensors, web click stream)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Schema on write vs. schema on read\n",
    "**Schema on Write**-preexisting data model, how traditional databases are designed (relational databases)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Schema on Read**-data model determined later, depends on how you want to use it (XML, JSON); capture and store the data, and worry about how you want to use it later.\n",

    "## NoSQL database\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "1. Doesn't use relational model or SQL language\n",
    "2. Runs well on distributed servers\n",
    "3. Most are open-source\n",
    "4. Built for the modern web\n",
    "5. Schema-less (though maybe some implicite schema); Supports schema on read\n",
    "6. Not ACID compliant (can't guarantee instant transfer)\n",
    "7. Eventually consistent\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** to improve programer productivity (OR mismatch); to handle larger dta volumes and throughput (big data)\n",

    "Comparison Between NoSQL and Relational DBs\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL DBs need to be available all the time. Facebook / Twitter needs to ensure that users can access and post to its site and app all the time, even if the data is not consistent. For example, users expect to always see the number of likes on a post (or retweet count on a tweet), they do not mind if that number is slightly outdated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational DBs sacrifice availability for consistency. This means the DBs need to be consistent all the time for all the users. If there is potential for inconsistencies (such as two people booking the same seats to watch a movie), the database will sometimes be unavailable.\n",

    "#### Key-value stores\n",
    "**Key**=Primary key\n",
    "\n",
    "**Value**=anything (number, array, image, JSON); The application is in charge of interpreting what it means (most flexible and least structured)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operations**-Put (store), Get, Update\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:** Riak, Redis, Memcached, BerkeleyDB, HamsterDB, Amazon DynamoDB, Project Voldemort, Couchbase\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Document databases\n",
    "Similar to a key-value store except that the document is examinable by the databases, so its content can be queried, and parts of it updated\n",
    "\n",
    "**Document**=JSON file\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:** MongoDB, CouchDB, Terrastore, OrientDB, RavenDB\n",

    "**Aggregate-oriented**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key-value, documnet store and column-family are aggregate-oriented-store business object in its entirety databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "1. entire aggregate of data is stored together (no need for transactions)\n",
    "2. efficient storage on clusters/distributed databases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    "1. hard to analyse across subfields of aggregates (e.g. sum over products instead of orders)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Column families\n",
    "Columns rather than rows are stored together on disk; This is like automatic vertical partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Makes analysis faster, as less data is fetched\n",
    "\n",
    "Related columns grouped together into families\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**  Cassandra, BigTable, HBase (Facebook, Netflix, Twitter)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graph databases\n",
    "A graph is a node-and-arc network; and Graphs are difficult to program in relational DB\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph DB stores entities and their relationships; Graph queries deduce knowledge from the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:** Neo4j (Airbnb, Microsoft), Infinite Graph, OrientDBv, FlockDB, TAO\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "1. Key-value stores<br/>\n",
    "A simple pair of a key and an associated collection of values. Key is usually a string. The database has no knowledge of the structure or meaning of the values\n",
    "2. Document stores<br/>\n",
    "Like a key-value store, but document goes further than value. The document is structured, so specific elements can be manipulated separately.\n",
    "3. Column-family stores<br/>\n",
    "Data is grouped in column groups/families for efficiency reasons.\n",
    "4. Graph-oriented databases<br/>\n",
    "Maintain information regarding the relationships between data items. Nodes with properties\n"

The data will propagate to everythwere it needs to, sooner or later, but the system will continue to receive input and is not checking the consistency of every transaction before it moves onto the next one.\n",
